NAVIGATION:
- limit/resepct the maximum steering radious (for the path-plan)
- shift the car in the middle of the road
- correct the path when its too short, errors raising due to point reduction


VISUALIZATION:
X(Pabs)add UX windows and improve texts in graphs. ** I have to add one when the path is computed
    - add labels to specify the next steps
- another plot with less zoom in to show better the whole car in the world
X(JB)- give out car velocity in km/h
X(Pabs) Add simulation time label
- Resize the car with the correct lenght, look if the map and the car are not in scale between each other


CONTROL:
- sensor fusion (aron)
X(JB)- make car stop when reaching end point
X(JB)- make car roll out when no fuel anymore
- The speed is not well simulated, each pixel is 0.56m so if our car goes with a speed of 10m/s it should seems faster in the simulation

CODE:
- reestructure main.py (pablo) 
    (xJB)- put setup at the beginning of the main
    X(Pabs) write comments how to use the code and execute the simulation. Should we add a README.txt?????
    X(Pabs) add .gitignore for pycache 
    X(Pabs) When you execute the main in debug mode you get and error (some index array issue in path planning. Please fix that)
